## Together, the makeCacheMatrix and cacheSolve functions cache the inverse of a matrix.

## Creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    
}


## Computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix.
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
    ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
